"""Reusable on-demand model registration.

Extracted from ``app/server.py``'s multi-handler lifespan loop
(on-demand branch only — lines ~326-339 at extraction time) so that
``POST /admin/models/add`` can register hot-added on-demand models
with identical semantics. A hot-added on-demand model is
indistinguishable from a config-declared on-demand model after this
function returns.

**Resident registration is NOT extracted.** v0.1.1 admin rejects
``on_demand: false`` because the spawn boundary requires the full
``ModelEntryConfig`` shape (~25 fields) that the admin request body
doesn't carry. Resident hot-add lands in v0.1.2 with a proper
config-passthrough surface.
