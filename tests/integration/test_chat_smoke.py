"""Chat-completion smoke tests against a real Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit server.

Two tests share the session-scoped `chat_server` fixture from conftest:

* `test_non_streaming_completion`: POST `/v1/chat/completions` with `stream=False`,
  assert HTTP 200 and a non-empty assistant message.
* `test_streaming_completion`: POST with `stream=True`, parse the SSE chunks
  and assert at least one valid `choices[0].delta` payload arrives before
  the `[DONE]` sentinel.

The fixture boots the server once and reuses it; first run can take 5+ minutes
on a cold HuggingFace cache.

KNOWN BUG (2026-06-05) — see ``_KNOWN_STREAM_AFFINITY_BUG`` below. The tests
are marked ``xfail(strict=False)`` so a future fix flips them to ``xpassed``
and prompts removal of the marker, while CI today is not red on a pre-existing
inherited bug. Test bodies remain authoritative — fix the server, drop the
marker, get a green ``smoke`` lane.

# Inherited from upstream cubist38/mlx-openai-server: chat-completion requests
# fail with HTTP 500 ``Failed to generate text response: There is no
# Stream(gpu, N) in current thread.`` mlx-lm's batch generation evaluates
# arrays whose source stream is the subprocess-main-thread-local
# ``generation_stream`` (allocated at ``mlx_lm.generate`` import). The
# BatchScheduler thread evaluates them under its OWN thread-local stream,
# and ``mx.eval(...)`` fails to synchronize with a stream owned by a different
# thread. Fixing this requires either an upstream mlx-lm PR that thread-locals
# all of ``stream_generate``'s stream references, or a substantial local
# rewrite of the generation entry points. Out of scope for Phase 6 (smoke
# tests are the deliverable). Repro: any POST to /v1/chat/completions.
# Triage notes are in the Phase 6 partial-delivery report.
