"""Concurrent chat smoke: 4 simultaneous streams must not cross-contaminate.

Sends 4 concurrent ``/v1/chat/completions`` requests, each asking the model
to repeat a distinct marker string. Each response MUST contain its own
marker and NONE of the others — any leakage indicates the BatchScheduler's
KV cache is bleeding generated tokens between sequences sharing a batch.

Markers use a distinctive base32-ish alphabet (no spaces, no model-vocab
sub-tokens) so substring matching is unambiguous. Budget is generous
(120s) because 4 concurrent streams on the 1B model on a single GPU
serializes through one BatchGenerator and runs ~2-3x slower per stream
than a solo run.

# Use a distinct marker per request. Capital-letter + digit groups avoid
# accidental in-text collisions and aren't subwords of common English
# tokens. Each one is unique by construction.

# Markers intentionally have no underscores or other punctuation Llama tends
# to elide when reproducing tokens verbatim — the KV-contamination check is
# what we care about, and a brittle "exact substring" test would noise it.
