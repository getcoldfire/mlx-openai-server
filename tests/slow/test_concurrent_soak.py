"""Task 27b: 15-minute 8-stream concurrent soak.

Drives 8 concurrent streaming chat completions for 15 minutes, each with a
unique marker. Asserts no KV cache cross-contamination: each stream's
response must contain its own marker and no marker from another stream.

This is the long-duration counterpart to the 4-request smoke version in
``tests/integration/test_concurrent_smoke.py``. The smoke proves the
property momentarily; this soak proves it stays true under sustained
concurrent load, where KV-cache reuse, scheduler races, and
event-loop starvation are most likely to surface.

Concurrency note: the upstream server's ``--max-concurrency`` defaults to
something ≥ 8 (see Phase 5 CLI flag work). If a future build lowers it,
this test will queue rather than parallelize — still correct, just slower.

Never runs in CI. Invoked via ``make test-soak``.
