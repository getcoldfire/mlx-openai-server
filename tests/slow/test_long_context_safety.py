"""Task 27a: long-context safety.

Guards against upstream mlx-lm issue #883 — a kernel panic observed at
~58k context length on M3 Ultra. The assertion is "the test process and
server subprocess survive" (HTTP 200 or 503 are both acceptable; OOM with a
clean error is fine; what we won't tolerate is silent process death or a
macOS kernel panic).

Why we use ~16k instead of 50k tokens:

* The smoke fixture model is Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit, which has a
  declared context window of 128k. Even 16k exercises the long-context
  attention + RoPE-scaling code paths well past the typical "short
  prompt" fast path.
* Pushing to 50k on a 1B model on a typical M-series chip risks OOM on
  the test machine itself (not a regression — just a hostile test).
* The bug we're chasing manifests when the kernel-level Metal scheduler
  gets large allocations queued; 16k allocations are large enough to
  trigger the same code path. If a future test machine has more
  headroom, parametrize the test to push higher.

Token estimation: ~10 chars/token for English. ~16k tokens ≈ 160k chars.

Never runs in CI. Invoked via ``make test-soak``.
