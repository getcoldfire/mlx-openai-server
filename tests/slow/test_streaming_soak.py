"""Task 24: 1-hour sustained streaming soak.

Verifies that streaming chat completions can run for an hour without:

* crashing the server subprocess (kernel panic, OOM kill, segfault)
* leaking memory beyond a calibrated RSS-growth ceiling

The RSS ceiling starts at 200 MB above baseline — this is an initial,
intentionally generous target. Once we have a real baseline number from the
first successful run, tighten to baseline + 50 MB.

Runs against the session-scoped ``chat_server`` fixture (re-exported from
``tests/integration/conftest.py``). PID is read from the fixture's tuple so
we attach ``psutil`` directly to the server subprocess, not the test
process.

This test is ``@slow`` — never runs in CI. Invoked via ``make test-soak``.
