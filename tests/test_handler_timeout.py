"""Regression tests for upstream issue #307: handler subprocess robust to TimeoutError.

The dispatch path in ``handler_process`` runs each inbound request as an
``asyncio.Task`` under ``_handle_request``. Before this patch, an
``asyncio.TimeoutError`` raised by the handler method was caught by the generic
``except Exception`` branch and reported with ``status_code=500``. That's
wrong in two ways:

  - It conflates a known-recoverable condition (the upstream request took too
    long) with an unknown server crash.
  - The OpenAI API convention is to use 504 Gateway Timeout for upstream
    timeouts, which lets clients (cli-v2, gateways, etc.) treat them as a
    retriable failure mode rather than a "panic and crash" signal.

Issue #307 was triggered when the handler subprocess saw a ``TimeoutError``
and the error path's logging / response shape was thin enough that downstream
saw "handler crashed" symptoms (no readable status, often connection close).

The patch adds a dedicated ``except TimeoutError`` arm that:
  - logs at WARNING (not ERROR) — the request timed out, the process is fine,
  - reports ``status_code=504``,
  - keeps the subprocess alive and ready for the next request.

These tests verify the behavior of ``_handle_request`` against a stubbed
handler+queue. They do NOT spawn a real subprocess (too expensive for a
unit test) but exercise the exact code path on the handler side.
